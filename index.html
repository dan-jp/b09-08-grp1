    <p>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gender role beliefs are widely held beliefs 
      about what roles are appropriate for men and appropriate for women. For example, 
      girls and women are generally expected to dress in typically feminine ways and be 
      polite, accommodating, and nurturing. Men are generally expected to be strong, 
      aggressive, and bold. <br><br>
  
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every society, ethnic group, and culture has gender role expectations, but they 
      can be very different from group to group. This way they develop their own ideas, 
      expectations and norms about how men and women behave, which will subsequently 
      influence how they process and experience gender-related information.</p>

  <p class="prebody-paragraph1">
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Gender is defined as socially constructed norms and 
    ideologies which determine the behavior and actions 
    of men and women. Understanding these gender 
    relations and the power dynamics behind them is a 
    prerequisite for understanding individuals access to
     and distribution of resources, the ability to 
    make decisions and the way women and men, boys 
    and girls are affected by political processes and 
    social development.
  </p>
  
  <img class="prebody-img" src="pictures/prebody-img.jpg">
  <p class="prebody-paragraph2">  Gender roles are cultural and personal. They 
    determine how males and females should think, speak, 
    dress, and interact within the context of society. 
    Learning plays a role in this process of shaping gender
     roles. These <strong>gender schemas </strong>are deeply embedded 
     cognitive frameworks regarding what defines masculine 
     and feminine.

    It is also adopted during childhood and normally continues into 
    adulthood. At home, people have certain presumptions about 
    decision‐making, child‐rearing practices, financial responsibilities, 
    and so forth.

<section class="Examples">
  <div class="example-body"> 
<p class="example-title"> Examples</p>
<p class="example-paragraph1"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These beliefs are related to a 
  larger focus being placed on Parents, OFW’s, and Worker’s careers and 
  child’s future. The social identities of particular women and men, 
  projected future social positions, and short- and long-term aspirations
   are then likely to be influenced by such ideas.
</p>

<p class="titleparagraph-example"> That women stays home doing household 
  chores and childcare while men
  should do the work.
</P>
<p class="bodyparagraph-example">In public places, we saw more men than women outside the home. 
  You can see it either in the workplace, offices, governments, 
  or even the commuters. Not only in the Philippines, but also in 
  other countries based on YaleGlobal Online Data. (The database was 
  started back in 2016).</p>
<img src="pictures/workdata.jpg" class="example-img">
<p class="bodyparagraph-example">In addition, childrearing increases
   levels of part-time work among mothers. In most countries, 
   the incidence of part-time employment is higher for women than men. 
   For mothers with young children, the impact of having a partner or 
   being a single parent is mixed. In some workplaces, women earn less 
   than men. So if childcare becomes unaffordable, it’s more likely that 
   the mother in this scenario will give up work. Also of experiencing 
   guilt more than men do, and worry more about the effect on their 
   children of having two working parents.</p>


   <p class="titleparagraph-example">Gender Stereotypes</p>
<p class="bodyparagraph-example">Like this video, it discusses what gender 
  roles and stereotypes actually are. It explores how and  why people 
  believe that males should work and support the family while women should
   stay at home. In the film's description, the creator also mentioned how 
   <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FigeKLGSsRk" target="_blank"> Gender 
    Stereotypes</a>  were present in their daily lives and that they 
   intended to spread awareness by creating and sharing the video.</p>

<p class="titleparagraph-example">Parenting</p>
<p class="bodyparagraph-example">Example of this is from a Quora user named 
  <a href="https://www.quora.com/profile/Michelle-Plummer-6" target="_blank"> Michelle Plummer</a>. 
  Based on her profile, she answers some common questions 
  like how to raise a child or how she feels about being a housewife.</p>

<p class="solution-paragraph">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Teach your children. Students should be 
  given the chance to identify the gender-biased attitudes and notions 
  that will impede them from becoming their actual selves and attaining 
  their full potential if they do not challenge them, which is why gender
   stereotype education is very important. <br><br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As an adult or parent, we should look after the kids when they reach a 
  certain stage. Parents must directly communicate their beliefs about 
  gender by providing instruction, guidance, and training to their 
  children. </p>
